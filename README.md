Mystery Disk
------------

This is just some materials about analyzing a broken ext2 filesystem that I found on some old external hard drive.

Mostly to provide additional info for my question on Unix & Linux Stackexchange:
[How did my ext3 superblocks get so messed up? And how to fix them?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/699212/how-did-my-ext3-superblocks-get-so-messed-up-and-how-to-fix-them)
