Preparing to scan filesystem in mystery-disk.img for ext2/3/4 superblocks.

Info: Second argument missing. Deriving magic bytes offsets cache file name from filesystem file name:
mystery-disk.ext3-magic-bytes-offsets.txt
To use custom magic bytes offsets cache file, rerun and specify file name as second argument.

Omitting scan for magic bytes. Using cached offsets from file mystery-disk.ext3-magic-bytes-offsets.txt instead.
To trigger a new scan for magic bytes, delete the file and rerun!

Scan for superblocks complete. Found 21 candidate superblocks.
